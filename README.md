# Gifyoda
## Description
WHEN the user enters a sentence or phrase <br/>
THEN it will be translated into how Yoda would say it <br/>
WHEN the user generates a yoda-speak quote <br/>
THEN they will be able to match that quote with a Starwars gif <br/>
WHEN the user matches their text to a gif <br/>
THEN they will be able to dowload the content <br/>

## User Story
As a Starwars fan, I want to be able to add phrases in said in Yoda-speak to Starwars gifs, so that I can constantly entertain myself and my fellow Starwars fans with constant Yoda humor.
